    <h2>Welcome to DecodeMTL :)</h2>
    <p>
      If you are reading this document, it's either because you signed up to one of our upcoming
      <a href="/web-development-full-time">full-time web development bootcamps</a>, or because you signed up to our
      <a href="/on-demand">on-demand online web development course</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either way, this preparatory material is the first step in your journey to become a web developer. The material is
      designed to get your feet wet with web development, and help you answer the question of whether or not you want to
      pursue your web development learning further.
    </p>
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <p>
      By going through this preparatory material, you should gain a good general understanding of web development. You
      will learn the following things:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The very fundamentals of HTML and CSS</li>
      <li>Some cool tricks to make you a CSS-ninja</li>
      <li>The very fundamentals of JavaScript</li>
      <li>How to use Git and GitHub to manage code and collaborate with a team</li>
      <li>The very fundamentals of your computer's command line interface</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Commitment</h3>
    <p>
      This preparatory material will take anywhere between 30-40 hours to complete. If you are applying to our full-time
      bootcamp, completing this material before starting the bootcamp is <strong>mandatory</strong>. Failing to do so,
      you will be playing a catch-up game during class.
    </p>
    <h3>Community and Mentoring</h3>
    <p>
      You are not expected to complete all this material by yourself. The rule of thumb is:
      <strong>
        If you get stuck for more than 15 minutes, be sure toget in touch with us for hints and/or explanations.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you sign-up, you will be invited to our Slack channel where you can communicate with peers who will be at
      various stages of completion of this material. The channel is also staffed with one or more mentors who can help
      answer your questions about the material.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you signed up to our full-time bootcamp or taking this course as a standalone introduction to web development,
      you will have received a separate instructions for 1-on-1 mentoring. We strongly encourage you to make use of this
      private mentoring time to solidify your understanding of the subjects we teach.
    </p>
    <h3>Assignments</h3>
    <p>
      Throughout the course, you will be required to complete some assignments.

  <div class="section-content">
    <h2>Getting Started!</h2>
    <p>Before getting started, we'll need to equip ourselves with some tools.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3><a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Download Google Chrome</a></h3>
        <p>
          Google Chrome will be used as the main development browser during the training. Its integrated set of debugging
          tools makes developers' lives easier. Chrome's rendering engine is used by multiple browsers, giving you a good
          idea of what your pages would look like in many different settings.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.github.com/">Signup for a GitHub account</a></h3>
        <p>
          Git and GitHub will be a constant part of our workflow. While Git will enable us to keep track of the history
          of code that we write and manage variations in our code, GitHub will enable us to share and collaborate the code
          we write.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this section, you are only tasked with signing up for a GitHub account. The last section of the prep material
          deals with your introduction to Git and GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a good place to mention that your GitHub username and profile have the same visibility as your profiles
          on facebook, twitter or LinkedIn. GitHub is the network of code in the same manner that LinkedIn is the network
          of professionals. Employers will look at your GitHub profile for signs of your experience and interest. At this
          point, make sure to create a profile that represents you. Later on, we will fill your GitHub with various projects
          that will demonstrate the knowledge you have learned through DecodeMTL.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://c9.io/">Signup for Cloud9 IDE</a></h3>
        <p>
          Just like we edit our spreadsheets in Open Office or Excel, web pages and web applications need their own
          editor. Cloud9 is an IDE &mdash; Integrated Development Environment &mdash; in the cloud. This is just technical
          mumbo-jumbo. It's a text editor on steroids, and already has installed most of the tools we will need during
          the bootcamp. Everything you do in Cloud9 is saved online, so you are able to start coding from any computer
          that has internet access. You don't even need to install anything on your machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Make sure to use the "Sign in with GitHub" option
          </strong>
          when signing up to Cloud 9. This will link your GitHub account to your Cloud 9 account, allowing for an easier
          workflow between your code editor and source code repository.

    <h2>HTML &amp; CSS</h2>
    <p>
      HTML and CSS are the fundamental languages of the web. Using only these two languages, we are able to create
      compelling, informative landing pages and micro-sites.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this part of the preparatory course, you will be going through some online classes covering the bases of HTML
      and CSS.

        <h3>Assignment: Create a page about your favourite movie</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of this HTML and CSS assignment is to review the material of this section. The instructions below
          should be viewed as a starting point only. You are encouraged to experiment as much as you like on the
          technologies that you just discovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the Cloud 9 IDE, create a new public project. Inside this project, create a file called <code>movie.html</code>.
          Create the content for your movie as you see fit. Try to use as much semantic HTML as possible. At the very
          minimum, your page should have the movie's title, a poster, description, categories/tags and trailer. Perhaps
          you could even add a photo grid of action shots from the movie? Use your imagination and have fun :)
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure to start only with your semantic HTML and add the CSS later on. Your page will look boring at first,
          but you'll quickly be able to change that using some CSS. Working on the HTML and CSS separately has some
          advantages. It lets you concentrate on one thing at a time without distractions. Separating concerns also shows
          you that you can easily change the style of your page without touching the content at all. A great example of
          this way of doing things is the <a target="_blank" href="http://csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>: this showcase of CSS code
          is all based on the exact same HTML markup. If you are curious, you can even take a look inside using your
          Chrome Development Tools!
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you are satisfied with your HTML content &mdash; you should have at least <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>,
          <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags
          &mdash; you should start working on the CSS for the page. Here we will only give you some directives, and let
          you use your imagination for the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try to make it so that the poster and main content are flowing next to each other using <code>float</code>s.
          Find a place or two that could benefit from a <code>:hover</code> effect. Try to use CSS transitions to make
          the hover effect smooth. If it's appropriate to your choice of design, use rounded corners on the movie's
          cover or on the action shots. Perhaps use a custom font through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/fonts">Google
          Fonts</a>? Again here, give free reign to your imagination and creativity. Remember to look at Zen Garden for
          inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout this process, remember to refresh the page as often as possible in Cloud 9's preview window. This
          iterative process is how your fellow web developers work on a daily basis. Don't forget to use Chrome's Developer
          Tools to help you tweak your CSS fast, then copy the result in your text editor.

  <div class="section-content">
    <h2>Javascript &amp; jQuery</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript originated as a language to add dynamic functionality to a web page. Over the years, it has evolved into
      a platform for creating full web-based applications on the front-end, as well as a back-end platform mainly through
      NodeJS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though this part of the preparatory material deals with JavaScript from a front-end perspective, a lot of the
      general programming concepts will apply on the back-end as well when we look at NodeJS. Since JavaScript is an integral
      part of this bootcamp, this section is the most important.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3><a target="_blank" href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript">Codecademy's JavaScript track</a></h3>
        <p>
          Go through all the chapters of this track.

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Assignment: Adding functionality through jQuery</h3>
        <p>
          This assignment picks up where we left off with the HTML and CSS assignment. Here, we will add some dynamic
          functionality to the movie page we created. Accomplishing this assignment will require a great deal of
          resourcefulness and patience. You might need our help too, so don't forget to stay on the Slack channel at all
          times.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this assignment, the goal is to enable the user viewing the page to suggest new tags/categories that we
          should add to the movie listing. Transmitting this suggested data to us will require a back-end of some sort
          to receive, store and manage the data but this is not part of the assignment. Here, we will only concentrate
          on the front-end part of the assignment: giving the user an interface through which they can add new tags and
          / or categories, and a button to send them. In this version of the assignment, when "sending" the suggested tags
          we will simply <code>alert</code> them back to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          The requirements of the assignment are purposely vague. For one, this mimicks a real company environment where
          work often has to start before requirements are fully set in stone. This will also give you the opportunity
          to communicate with us to clarify the requirements.

    <h2>NodeJS: JavaScript for the back-end</h2>
    <p>
      Now that you have completed the section on JavaScript and jQuery, you should be somewhat introduced to the JavaScript
      language. Even though we will be using the same language on the back-end, the concepts are not all the same: front-end
      JavaScript deals more with UI logic, and less with data and I/O (input/output). On the back-end side, we will be
      using JavaScript to talk to databases and other back-ends (APIs).
    </p>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, all these I/O operations happen <strong>asynchronously</strong>, almost like sending a message in
      a bottle. This section introduces you to some of the concepts that will come up when doing JavaScript on the
      back-end.

    <h2>Git & GitHub</h2>
    <p>
      History management is an integral part of writing software. Throughout the history of a piece of software, be it a
      web site, web application or other, changes will happen. Often, features that are not ready for prime-time will
      have to be developed in parallel. And in most cases, software will be worked on by multiple developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git is a tool that empowers developers to accomplish these features without having to worry about the state of the
      project. If you've ever written a Word document, you may have found yourself creating a copy at some point, in order
      to try something else. Among other things, Git gives you the ability to branch off and create new features while
      keeping the working version of your software clean. It also lets you go back in time to a previous working version
      and examine it, without ever losing your work.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub is like a "social network around Git". It is a web site that lets you publish your Git-managed projects
      online for others to see and collaborate on. Your GitHub profile is the equivalent of your LinkedIn profile for
      technical employers. In it, anyone can see what projects you have shared and contributed to. This is why it is
      important to document your adventures in web development by publishing as much of your work as possible to GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this part of the course, we will start by learning to use Git. Git is a program that you have to install on your
      system. Fortunately in our case, since we are doing all our work inside the Cloud 9 IDE, Git is already installed
      for us. Cloud 9 has even already configured our Git installation to tag all the work we do with our name and
      e-mail address.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only thing we have to do is get started using Git :) Start by completing the following tutorial:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a target="_blank" href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">Try Git</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you are comfortable with the material in this tutorial, try applying it to a new project inside the Cloud 9
      IDE. Create a new empty project, open a terminal window with <strong>Window > New Terminal</strong>, and try to
      create a new Git repository. Then, create a new HTML file through the IDE, put some content into it and try to
      commit the file in your Git repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      In parallel with this exercise, now is a good time to learn the basics of your command line. Follow this tutorial

    <h2>You are done :)</h2>
    <p>
      Pat yourself on the back. If you've successfully completed all the sections above, you should now have a pretty
      solid introduction to many of the tools and languages used in web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now would be a good time to look back at what you have done, and, with your newly acquired powers and skills, take
      all the assignments that you have done and publish them on GitHub as separate projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, don't forget to let us know that you are done! We will review your journey together and address any remaining
      confusions. If you wish, we will even give you some resources to push your learning further.
