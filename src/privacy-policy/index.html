        <p class="privacy-policy__body">There are some instances where we may need to disclose personal information
            to a third party service provider.  Whenever we engage a third party service provider, we confirm that its
            privacy and security standards meet our requirements.  In the event that a third party service provider is
            located outside of Canada, the government, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of that
            jurisdiction may be able to obtain disclosure of your personal information through the laws of that
            jurisdiction.</p>
        <p class="privacy-policy__body">By submitting your personal information to us, you have consented to our use

            of these purposes, you may notify us in writing at any time.  If you do not notify us, we will consider
            you to have consented to our continued use and disclosure of your personal information.  A notification

            information as required or permitted by law.</p>

        <p class="privacy-policy__body">Your personal information, hard copy or electronic, is accessible to you.
            However please note that if your information is combined with information of others
            (such as payroll spreadsheets), you will not be granted access to such information unless we are
            able to segment your personal information.  If your request for personal information entails a significant
            cost due to time, resources or copying, there may be a charge.</p>
